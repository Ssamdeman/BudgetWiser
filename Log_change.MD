Analytics Dashboard V1 — Complete! ✅

What's working:

Total summary: $5,707.94 across 8 months
Monthly Spending bar chart with trend line
Category Breakdown horizontal bars with distinct colors
Category normalization applied per your mapping
Also completed:

Upgraded to Next.js 16.1.1 + React 19.2.3
Fixed duplicate key warning in chart tooltip
Remaining console warning (hydration mismatch) is caused by a browser extension, not our code. Can be ignored or tested in incognito mode.
