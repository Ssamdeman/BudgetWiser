## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid orange (#FF6633) for high energy and clear call to action, like in the original image's heading and buttons.
- Background color: Dark grey (#0D0D0D), matches original image's dark background which suggests premium/modern app
- Accent color: Blue (#00BFFF), this provides visual contrast that harmonizes to the other two, suitable for active states, links, and interactive elements
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) provides clear on-screen reading, a good fit with mobile use; plus it works for headlines too so no pairing is needed
- Use clean, minimalist icons for categories and moods. Consider rounded icons to align with overall design.
- Mobile-first responsive design with swipeable tabs. Prioritize data entry view on initial load. Employ the existing theme's spacings and padding.
- Subtle animations on form submission and tab transitions.
